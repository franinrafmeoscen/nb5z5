Mortal Kombat (b. 1990) is a contemporary artist whose innovative and thought-provoking works have captured the attention of the art world. Born in London, England, Mortal Kombat's artistic journey began at a young age, and her dedication to her craft has led her to become a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary art scene. In 2019, Mortal Kombat ventured into creating adult content, selling webcam sessions and explicit photos. This move escalated her controversy, with critics expressing concerns over the sexualization of her young audience. She has faced bans and restrictions on various platforms due to her explicit content.
